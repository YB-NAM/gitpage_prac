To address such issues, I started by drawing an ER diagram and sought advice from my professor during office hours. I also reached out to other senior students for guidance, initiating a collaborative effort to resolve the challenges I encountered.

Additionally, in the backend, I implemented a function to accurately store the specified locations from the map into the database and retrieve them only when needed. This solution resolved the problem. An additional improvement method was to store a value in the user table indicating whether the user had granted real-time location sharing. This information could then be saved as a cookie, ensuring that the permission for real-time location sharing would not be queried every time the user logs in."}]]}]]}]]}],["$","a",null,{"href":"/","children":["$","button",null,{"className":"inline-flex items-center justify-center whitespace-nowrap font-medium focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-1 focus-visible:ring-ring disabled:pointer-events-none disabled:opacity-50 bg-primary text-primary-foreground shadow h-8 rounded-md px-3 text-xs w-full hover:bg-gray-700 hover:text-white transition-all duration-200","children":"Home"}]}],["$","section",null,{"className":"w-full py-12 px-8 space-y-12","id":"tag1","children":[["$","h3",null,{"className":"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200","children":"Projects"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-8","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"w-full bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg shadow-md overflow-hidden","children":[["$","img",null,{"alt":"Project 1","className":"w-full h-auto max-w-[200px] max-h-[200px] aspect-[1/1] object-cover object-center","src":"/web-372.png","style":{"aspectRatio":"200/200","objectFit":"cover"}}],["$","div",null,{"className":"p-1","children":[["$","h4",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200","children":"Full-stack webpage"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-gray-600 mt-2 dark:text-gray-400","children":"Using Angular with Typescript, Apache server, Postgresql"}],["$","button",null,{"className":"inline-flex items-center justify-center whitespace-nowrap rounded-md text-sm font-medium transition-colors focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-1 focus-visible:ring-ring disabled:pointer-events-none disabled:opacity-50 shadow h-9 px-4 py-2 mt-4 text-white bg-purple-500 hover:bg-purple-600 dark:bg-gray-800 dark:hover:bg-gray-700","children":["$","a",null,{"href":"/sample1","children":"Go to Project details"}]}]]}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"w-full bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg shadow-md overflow-hidden","children":[["$","img",null,{"alt":"Project 2","className":"w-full h-auto max-w-[200px] max-h-[200px] aspect-[1/1] object-cover object-center","src":"/webgl.png","style":{"aspectRatio":"200/200","objectFit":"cover"}}],["$","div",null,{"className":"p-2","children":[["$","h4",null,{"className":"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200","children":"WebGL (computer graphic)"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-gray-600 mt-2 dark:text-gray-400","children":"Using Javascript, CSS, HTML with WebGL.
